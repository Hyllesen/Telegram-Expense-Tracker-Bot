# Credentials Directory

This directory should contain your Google Service Account JSON file.

## Setup

1. Download your service account JSON from Google Cloud Console
2. Place it in this directory
3. **Important:** Rename it to `google_service_account.json` (exact name required)
4. Update your `.env` file:
   - For local: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDS_FILE=./credentials/google_service_account.json`
   - For Docker: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDS_FILE=/app/credentials/service_account.json`

## Docker Volume Mount

The `docker-compose.yml` file mounts:
- **Local:** `./credentials/google_service_account.json`
- **Container:** `/app/credentials/service_account.json`
- **Mode:** Read-only (`:ro`)

This means the file is NOT baked into the Docker image - it's mounted at runtime.

## Security

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never commit credentials to Git!

This directory is excluded in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

## Example Structure

```
credentials/
├── .gitkeep (placeholder for git)
└── google_service_account.json (your credentials - DO NOT COMMIT!)
```

## Permissions

For Docker deployment:
```bash
chmod 644 google_service_account.json
chmod 755 credentials
```
